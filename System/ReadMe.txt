This folder is for any code that covers more than one part of the system.

PLEASE NOTE this is not for Raspberry Pi code which uses other subsystems code, rather single pieces of code which utilise more than one subsystem.

Naming Convention:
sys1_sys2_func.file
- sys1 = first subsystem
- sys2 = second subsystem
- func = function of the code
- .file = file type
Expand for more than 2 systems = sys1_sys2_sys3... etc.
